## Introduction

Welcome to the Laravel Database Interaction README! This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up your Laravel project, connecting to a MySQL database, and creating and interacting with users, posts, and categories using the Tinker tool.

## Installation

To create a new Laravel project named "app-example," run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel app-example
```
````

This command creates a new Laravel project named "app-example."

## Running the Application

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This command will start the development server, allowing you to access your Laravel application locally.

## Connect to the Database

To connect to your MySQL database, use the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

This command opens a MySQL command line interface where you can interact with your database.

## Migrate the Database

Create the necessary database tables by running the migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This command will create the required database tables based on your Laravel migrations.

## Creating a New User and Adding It to the Database Using Tinker

You can create a new user and add it to the database using Laravel's Tinker tool. Follow these steps:

1. Create a migration for the "categories" table:

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_categories_table
```

This command generates a migration file for the "categories" table.

2. Create a model for the "Category" entity:

```bash
php artisan make:model Category
```

This generates a model for the "Category" entity.

3. Run the migration to create the "categories" table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This command executes the migration, creating the "categories" table in the database.

4. Retrieve a post with its associated category using PHP code like this:

```php
$post = \App\Models\Post::with('category')->first();
```

This code retrieves a post from the database along with its associated category.

5. Access the post's category name with the following PHP code:

```php
$post->category->name;
```

This code allows you to access the name of the post's category.

## Working with the Database

Here are some useful commands for working with the database:

-   **Refresh and seed the database:**

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
php artisan db:seed
```

These commands refresh the database schema and seed it with sample data.

-   **Add fake data to the database using Tinker:**

```bash
php artisan tinker
$cat = \App\Models\Category::factory(30)->create();
```

This allows you to add fake data to the database using Laravel's Tinker tool.

## Notes

```html
<form action="/" method="POST">@csrf</form>
```

-   `@csrf` -> You must always include this in your form to prevent error 419 (CSRF token mismatch) when submitting forms.

-   `store` function:

```php
public function store()
{
    request()->validate([
        'name' => 'required:max:255',
        'username' => 'required:max:255|min:3',
        'email' => 'required|email:max:255',
        'password' => 'required:max:255|min:7',
    ]);

    ddd(request()->all());
}
```

-   `Rule::unique('users', 'username')`

```php
'username' => [
    'required',
    'min:3',
    'max:255',
    Rule::unique('users', 'username')
],
```

Laravel ensures that the 'username' field is unique in the 'users' table when using `Rule::unique`.

```php
protected $fillable = [
    'name',
    'username',
    'email',
    'password',
];
```

An alternative is to disable it and add `guarded = []`:

```php
/**
 * The attributes that are mass assignable.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $guarded = [];
```

This allows all fields to be mass assignable.

Find a specific ID in the DB:

```php
> \App\Models\User::find(62)
> = App\Models.User {#6468
    id: 62,
    username: "ronaldinho10",
    name: "ronaldinho",
    email: "ronaldinho@gmail.com",
    email_verified_at: null,
    #password: "$2y$10$sESFNsEe8KCgyw4AGe2CJetr1N0nXeSxezjHam9rtVy.CFJBUlUBS",
    #remember_token: null,
    created_at: "2023-10-27 10:12:33",
    updated_at: "2023-10-27 10:12:33",
}
```

This code retrieves a specific user with ID 62 from the database.

It

's essential to use the convention `set[Attribute]` for specific attribute handling:

```php
public function setPasswordAttribute($password) {
    $this->attributes['password'] = bcrypt($password);
}
```

This code defines a mutator for the 'password' attribute to automatically hash the password before storing it.

Handling errors in your forms:

```php
@error('name')
<p class="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1">{{ $message }}</p>
@enderror
```

This code displays an error message for the 'name' field in your form if there is an error.

Or, at the end of the form:

```html
<div class="mb-6">
    @foreach ($errors->all() as $error)
    <li class="text-red-500 text-xs">{{ $error }}</li>
    @endforeach
</div>
```

This code displays all validation errors at the bottom of your form.

Handling input values in your forms:

```html
<input
    class="border border-gray-400 p-2 w-full"
    type="email"
    name="email"
    id="email"
    required
    value="{{ old('name') }}"
/>
```

This code defines an input field for the 'email' attribute in your form, pre-filling it with the old input value.

## Comment Section

To create a Comment model along with its migration and factory, run:

```bash
php artisan make:model Comment -mfc
```

This command generates a Comment model, migration, and factory.

## Database

To migrate and seed the database from scratch, run:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This command resets the database, migrates the tables, and seeds it with data.

## Additional Steps

Here are additional steps and code snippets for your Laravel application:

### Post Model

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $guarded = [];

    protected $with = ['category', 'author'];

    public function comments()
    {
        return $

this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}
```

### Comment Model

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories.HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }

    public function author()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'user_id');
    }
}
```

### Interacting with Models

You can use Laravel Tinker to interact with your models. For example:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

In Tinker, you can explore relationships and data. For instance:

```php
$comment = App\Models\Comment::first()
$comment->post
$comment->author
```

This allows you to explore the relationships between models and access related data.

# disable Model::unguard();

class AppServiceProvider

    public function boot()
    {
        Model::unguard();
    }

if guarded is disabled NEVER do it
Post::create(request()->all())

```

```
